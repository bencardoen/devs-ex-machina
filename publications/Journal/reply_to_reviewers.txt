> The authors propose a new architecture for a PDEVS simulator. This simulator allows to dynamically change the simulation synchronization protocols for single machine parallelism.
> An implementation in C++11 is described implementing sequential, conservative and optimistic protocols. The tool implemented is evaluated using synthetic models based in DEVStone and PHOLD. Based on the results obtained, the authors discuss the challenges of memory allocation and core association. These challenges are different for different protocols, and motivate the switching approach.

We have reviewed the text to expand acronyms where this was not the case.

> -Page 7 (5 in the paper), lines 46-54. Authors mention, the inconvenience for modelers to be required to define lookahead in every model. An alternative is using the inheritance mechanisms of C++.
> Model could be defined with no look-ahead awareness as in classic simulators. Then, a "model-with-lookahead" can be defined as specialization of model. Then, a model can be specialized with look-ahead information when simulated in conservative protocol. That way, both can be passed to the "SequentialCore", but classic model will not be accepted by the "ConservativeCore" if passed.

The current default implementation of the lookahead function in the base model class has no performance impact in sequential or optimistic simulation, the compiler can deduce that this function is never invoked.
By providing it depending on the simulation type (by way of specialization) we would break one of our design aims, namely reusing the same model across the different synchronization protocols. This would further complicate the switching between optimistic and conservative at runtime, as it would involve a casting operation which may or may not fail at runtime.
Furthermore, a model designed for sequential simulation can be run in conservative simulation in the current design without providing a lookahead. Using our statistics module the author can then use the gathered information to set the actual lookahead.
We have modified the relevant paragraph to clarify this point.

>  - Page 8 (6 in the paper) lines 12 to 17, second column. Have you considered the use of transactional memory?

We have considered this, but unfortunately transactional memory is still not in the C++ standard. In our design we opted for maximum portability and using a non standard implementation would hinder this. There is ongoing work to include transactional memory in the C++17 standard but the current prototype implementation in GCC is too experimental to use, especially since the implementation uses a single lock which would constrain performance. We have modified our future work section to add this information.

>  - Figure 6 is explained before Figure 5

Corrected
 
> - Figure 7, line dxex w 800 is invisible in B&W, line adevs w800 is hard to see in B&W
> - Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, and 25 are plotted in different style than previous ones, also most lines cannot be distinguished, or are hard to read in B&W.
> - Figure 21 and 22 are hard to identify the light colours differences in B&W.

The graphs have been modified to use better distinguishable colors and line styles. The use of color has also been made more consistent.
 
> - Page 10 (8 in paper), line 41.  "An example for 4 models is shown in Figure 5", the Figure showed has 3 models and the interconnection is not HI.

Note that the model is indeed not HI, as the text mentions it is a merge between PHOLD and HI.

> - Page 17 (15 in paper), have you tried to assign different quentities of models per core? All examples seem to use equal quantity per core (with exception of the last core, taking less in some cases).

The scaling effects on performance have been investigated in the performance section. In this scenario (bfs vs dfs allocation) we specifically wanted to balance the model load over kernels. This will not always result in an equal load as is indeed shown in the allocation plot, but the main effect we want to demonstrate here is the effect of inter kernel communication and resulting dependencies between kernels this introduces. We have added a paragraph to section 6 to explain our reasoning.

> - Page 18 (16 in paper), lines 16 a 33, second column. CD++ has an effort of merging multiple approaches in a single simulator. However, the proposed approach is static, once the simulation starts, there is no dynamic protocol change. The new architecture for this approach is showed in [1], and a initial implementation in C++11 is evaluated.

We have updated the related work section.

> - In conclusions, it is mentioned that the main contribution is the implementation of the simulator. I believe the discussion over protocol switching, memory and core assignation is the core is more important.

We have included memory allocation result in the conclusion. The other topics are already mentioned in the conclusion.

A new subsection was added with extended results and discussion regarding these two papers, the related work section was updated with these references.

Thank you for notifying us about the quality of this reference. We have consequently removed it from our list of references.
 
> In addition please verify the references (at least  in 15  references the year of publication is missing).

The missing years are due to the Latex style file. Some @inproceedings don't include the year in their title. We have added the year field to every reference, so it isn’t our fault. We changed the items to @articles to work around this issue.

We have benchmarked 3 configurations that demonstrate the different aspects highlighted in the theoretical work and analyzed their results.

We have implemented this. PDEVS can operate with or without the synchronization protocols allowing for a in depth comparison.

> The results of the standard, conservative and optimistic methods need to be compared with the theoretical predictions

In a new subsection we analyze the performance differences between PDEVS, standard, optimistic and conservative.

We have implemented the requested changes.
