The introduction and abstract have been modified to address this. We clearly outline the 
complementary nature of the inter vs intra kernel synchronization protocols.

A subsection has been added, explaining the implementation and how it complements the synchronization protocols. 
In the introduction we clearly differentiate between the 6 potential approaches to parallelization.
The charts have been updated to avoid confusion in this regard.

We have updated this section to include the parameter p and correct the value of q in probabilistic simulations.

In our model the amount of external transitions parallelizable is maximized to cover this use case. 
After an initialization period the entire set of models is sending and receiving events. 
All models are executing transitions (internal and external) at a maximum frequency, thereby maximizing 
the possible speedup in this highly concurrent scenario. Adding an extra model with broadcast behavior 
would not lead to an increase in the number of concurrent external transitions.
We have updated the text to clarify this.
