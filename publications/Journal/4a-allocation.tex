uthor can specify which kernel a model should be allocated to, should such manual intervention be required. This is handled by the default model allocator. If no preference is given a simple striping scheme is followed but this is not sufficient in most simulations to achieve a speedup in parallel. In Section \nameref{sec:4-performance} we analyse the performance impact of allocation schemes. By overriding the default allocator a model author can tune the allocation scheme for a specific model to maximize parallel speedup. This interface can be in future work also be used to employ graph algorithms for an automatic allocation scheme, for example one that avoids cycles in the resulting kernel dependency graph.
