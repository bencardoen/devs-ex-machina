%TODO conclude the paper, saying that our new simulation tool offers conservative and optimistic synchronization, resulting in good performance, which is even better than adevs
%TODO future work: more things that we might want to implement, and probably something about automatically switching between synchronization protocols at runtime (and reference my activity papers ;))
