%TODO explain that we are briefly going over the main features
\subsection{Based on PythonPDEVS}
%TODO say that it is based on PythonPDEVS
%TODO ... and thus has most features from PythonPDEVS, like Dynamic Structure, termination condition, direct connection, ...
%TODO (size: take as much size as you want, depending on how much is shared with PythonPDEVS)
%TODO (maybe: note that models are not compatible)
\subsection{Different Synchronization protocols}
%TODO explain rationale: why different synchronization protocols
%TODO explain core infrastructure a bit, maybe with a diagram or so, which clearly shows that everything is shared, except the "synchronization" part
%TODO claim that this allows you to easily switch between both methods, to always chose the best one
\subsection{Performance Improvements}
%TODO briefly discuss some of the additional changes you implemented
%TODO such as memory pools, memory allocators, profiling-guided-optimizations, ...
