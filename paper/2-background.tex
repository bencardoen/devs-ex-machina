In this section, we provide a brief introduction to two different synchronization protocols for parallel simulation, and the features offered by C++11 that aid in our implementation.

\subsection{Conservative Synchronization}
%TODO explain conservative synchronization, and how it uses locking to wait for continuing the simulation
\subsection{Optimistic Synchronization}
%TODO explain optimistic synchronization, and how it uses rollbacks to undo causality errors
\subsection{C++11 Parallelism Features}
%TODO explain what is new in C++11 for parallelism and how it contributes to our cause
