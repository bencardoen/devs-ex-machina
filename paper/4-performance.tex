%TODO say that you will now prove your claims about the aproach having nearly no impact
%TODO and potentially even claim that you are faster than adevs for some situations, due to the algorithms from PythonPDEVS and further features
%TODO briefly give some hardware info on the machine (CPU, OS, RAM), used software (version of adevs, GCC, ...), and about number of samples/variance
\subsection{Sequential Simulation}
%TODO we start with sequential simulation results, because this is still base case
\subsubsection{CPU Usage}
%TODO compare CPU time with adevs for some benchmarks
%TODO and explain why there is such a difference
%TODO (spend some time here, as this is also important)
\subsubsection{Memory Usage}
%TODO compare memory usage with adevs for some benchmarks
%TODO remark our use of memory pools and such, but don't spend too much space on this
\subsection{Parallel Simulation}
%TODO explain that we will now compare different synchronization protocols
%TODO compare different synchronization protocols with adevs' conservative, showing that we are faster (or at least, not that much slower) than adevs
%TODO show a single plot which varies a parameter that changes the ideal synchronization protocol
%TODO (keep explaining as much as space permits, as this is the evaluation of the core contribution)
