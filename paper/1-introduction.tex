%TODO SIZE: approx. 1-2 column, every TODO is approx. one paragraph
%TODO give introduction to the field: parallel computing is necessary with more and more complex systems, blablabla (usual explanation)
%TODO give motivation (adevs is good, but only conservative; exploit new parallelism features of C++11 too)
%TODO give our solution, motivating the need for a different kernel, instead of modifying another kernel (like adevs or PythonPDEVS)
