Discrete Event Simulations are invaluable in reducing the complexity of analyzing large-scale systems. Reusability of models written by the user is often overlooked. When modelling complex systems, the user is forced to commit to a single parallel DEVS paradigm without future knowledge of the run-time characteristics of the simulation. In this paper we evaluate the performance of our new C++ parallel DEVS implementation offering both conservative and optimistic simulation by changing a single run-time parameter. Using statistical analysis and hardware level profiling of several benchmarks, we investigate the defining characteristics. We explore the performance and overhead involved when trying to leverage multicore architecture on non-trivial models. The same approach is used in differentiating conservative and optimistic DEVS. In addition to conservative and optimistic parallel simulation, the simulator supports dynamic structured DEVS.
